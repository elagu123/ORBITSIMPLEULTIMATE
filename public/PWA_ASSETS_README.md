# PWA Assets Required

This directory needs the following assets for the PWA to function properly:

## Required Icons
- `pwa-192x192.png` - 192x192 app icon
- `pwa-512x512.png` - 512x512 app icon  
- `favicon.ico` - 16x16, 32x32 favicon
- `apple-touch-icon.png` - 180x180 Apple touch icon
- `masked-icon.svg` - SVG icon for Safari pinned tabs

## Asset Generation
You can generate these assets from a high-quality SVG or PNG logo using:
1. Online tools like https://realfavicongenerator.net/
2. PWA Asset Generator: https://tools.crawlink.com/tools/pwa-icon-generator/
3. Command line tools like `pwa-asset-generator`

## Temporary Setup
For now, the PWA will work without these assets, but they should be added for production deployment.

## Colors Used in Manifest
- Theme Color: #3b82f6 (Blue)
- Background Color: #ffffff (White)

These should match your brand colors.
